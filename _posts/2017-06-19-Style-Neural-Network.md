### Analysing mangrove spectral signatures in French Guiana from satellite image time series

Mangroves are coastal ecosystems consisting of assemblages of salt-tolerant trees and shrubs that grow in the intertidal regions of the tropical and subtropical coastlines. They represent a distinctive vegetation type, which plays a crucial role in coastal protection, water purification, carbon sequestration, or biodiversity preservation by providing habitat for various species. Despite their key role, mangroves are threatened by various factors including human activity, climate change, and disease proliferation. Mapping mangroves and understanding their dynamics is therefore of utmost interest for ecosystem preservation.

###### Objectives
In this master thesis, we are interested in studying the suitability of Sentinel-2 time series to analyse mangrove spectral signatures in the French Guyana coastline.
