Its May 2015, and rescue teams are working to rebuild Nepal following the April [earthquake](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake)
(and its aftershocks). Can these efforts be helped by twitter?

In the previous post, I built a tweet summarizer, which took all of the tweets tweeted between April 25th and May 28th
and selected a short summary of tweets which would be most useful to rescue teams:

[Summarizing Tweets in a Disaster (part I)](https://gabrieltseng.github.io/2017/08/13/Tweets.html)

Now, I want to go one step further: rather than just selecting the best tweets, can I generate my own sentences which
effectively summarize all of the useful information in the tweets?

**Note**: this post is essentially an implementation of [this paper](https://itra.medialabasia.in/data/Documents/DISARM/publications/26.pdf);
its definitely worth reading if the subject interests you!

#### Contents:
1. **Making a word graph**:  I’ve already generated a summary of the best tweets, using content word tweet
summarization (in the [previous post](https://gabrieltseng.github.io/2017/08/13/Tweets.html)). I am going to use these
tweets, and consider all the possible word paths they contain (using a word graph).
2. **Investigating Informativeness and Linguistic Quality**: I will then select the best word paths, by defining some
new metrics: informativeness, and linguistic quality.
3. **Generating an Abstractive Summary**: Finally, I’ll use these best word paths to generate an abstractive summary
of the tweets.

I do this exercise twice, using both [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) and [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)as tokenizers
(and using their respective selections of tweets from the content word tweet summarization).

Link to notebooks for [spaCy](https://github.com/GabrielTseng/LearningDataScience/blob/master/natural_language_processing/twitter_disasters/spaCy/3%20-%20Abstractive%20Summary.ipynb)
and [NLTK](https://github.com/GabrielTseng/LearningDataScience/blob/master/natural_language_processing/twitter_disasters/NLTK/3%20-%20Abstractive%20Summary.ipynb).

## 1. Making a word graph
To generate my own sentences, I am going to take the best tweets, and consider all of the possible word paths contained
within them.

What exactly does this mean?

To understand what a word path is, I am first going to consider a word graph. A word graph is a graphical representation
of a sentence, with nodes representing words and edges representing connections between words. For instance, the sentence
“historic dharara tower collapses in kathmandu after 7.9 earthquake” could be represented with the following word graph:

![tweet_1](../../../assets/img/2017-08-28/tweets_1.png "tweet_1")

Word graphs become powerful when multiple sentences are added. For instance, lets say I add another sentence: “dharara
tower built in 1832 collapses in kathmandu during earthquake”: (credit to [Rudra et al](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2914600)
for this figure. [Bigrams](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bigram) rather than words are used at the nodes, but the principle
is otherwise the same.)

![tweet_2](../../../assets/img/2017-08-28/tweets_2.png "tweet_2")

Now, I can find word paths through this graph which are different from the original input sentences, for instance “dharara
tower built in 1832 collapses in kathmandu after 7.9 earthquake”. I’ve been able to extract a some information from both
input sentences, to make my own.

The goal of abstractive summarization is essentially to do this: generate my own word paths so isolate the best
information from tweets.

Taking my own tweets, I can generate a word graph from them using bigrams which I can then use to generate all of the
possible worth paths. Many of the word paths generate non sensical sentences, such as

```
[Nepal quake - Buildings collapse in Delhi for queries regarding tragic Earthquake Rocks Nepal victims']
```

so I am hoping to get **useful** word paths, which also **make sense**.

## 2. Informativeness and Linguistic Quality

To get useful word paths which make sense, there are two metrics I will measure: informativeness, and linguistic quality.

### 2.1. Informativeness

Informativeness really means how representative the tweet is of the corpus of tweets I have. Luckily, there is an
easy way to quantify that. When I was selecting tweets for the summarization in the last post, I generated something
called a tf-idf [term matrix](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Document-term_matrix). This is a matrix, containing all the
vocabulary for all the tweets:

![tweet_3](../../../assets/img/2017-08-28/tweets_3.png "tweet_3")

Each column represented a word. If a tweet in row `[i]` contains the word represented by column `[j]`, then matrix element
`[i][j]` will contain that word’s [tf-idf score](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Tf%E2%80%93idf). Otherwise, it will contain a 0.

I can therefore generate a vector which approximately represents the body of tweets, by finding the average of each column:

![tweet_4](../../../assets/img/2017-08-28/tweets_4.png "tweet_4")

Where the above image represents an array of height 1 with a length equal to the total vocabulary size of all the tweets,
populated by the column mean of each value for all the tweets.

I can generate a similar row for each word path, and compare the difference between this average-vector and the word path
vector. I do this finding their [cosine similarity](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Cosine_similarity), which measures the
cosine angle between the two vectors (smaller is more similar).

### 2.2. Linguistic Quality

Since many of the word paths are nonsensical, it is important to pick the grammatically correct sentences which make sense.
How can I do this?

One way is to look at how likely it is that sequences of words in the word paths I have chosen would occur in ‘correct English’.
I can do this by analyzing a text of ‘correct English’, and measuring how frequently different word sequences occur. I can then compare this to my word paths; if a word path is full of frequently occurring word sequences, it is more likely to be linguistically correct, so I will score it higher.

Word sequences of length n are known as n-grams, so this approach to linguistic quality is known as an n-gram linguistic
model.

\begin{equation}
P(w_{i} | w_{i-1}, w_{i-2})
\end{equation}

A trigram (an n-gram when n = 3) calculates the above equation: what is the probability that the next word in the word
path is the word that it is, considering the two words that came before it, where the probability is compared to a corpus of English.

Luckily, there is a toolkit called [kenlm](https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/) which has been designed to do exactly this
(and [here](http://masatohagiwara.net/training-an-n-gram-language-model-and-estimating-sentence-probability.html) is a
great post which goes into more detail on how linguistic quality is extracted from n-grams).

Using kenlm, I used the [Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA)](https://corpus.byu.edu/coca/) as my ‘correct
English’ reference, and scored the linguistic quality of the word paths.

## 3. Generating an Abstractive Summary

Just like in part 1, I used these components to generate an Integer Linear Problem, which could be solved. Considering
all the word paths, I wanted to select the word paths with the highest informativeness scores and the highest linguistic
quality, which also contain the most content words.

Mathematically, I can write this down as

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} LQ(i) \cdot I(i) \cdot x_{i} + \sum_{j=1}^{m} y_{m}
\end{equation}

where LQ is the linguistic quality and I is the informativeness of the ith word path, subject to the constraints that:

1. My total summary must be less than 150 words
2. If a content word is selected, a word path which contains that content word must also be selected
3. If a word path is selected, all content words in that word path must be selected.

I can also describe this mathematically as

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i} \cdot Length(i) \leq L
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i\in T_{j}}x_{i} \geq y_{j}, j=\[1, ..., m\]
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\sum_{j \in C_{i}} y_{j} \leq |C_{i}| \times x_{i}, i=\[1, ..., n\]
\end{equation}

I then used [pymathprog](http://pymprog.sourceforge.net/), and integer programming module, to solve these equations
(by maximizing the first equation, subject to the constraints of the second three equations).

This yielded the following results for spaCy:

These are not great, and the tweet summarization is definitely a better method way of capturing the best useful tweets
than abstractive summarization. Some of the word paths do make sense, but the vast majority do not.

## 4. Conclusion

This was an interesting incursion into Natural Language Processing. In particular, it was awesome to see how data science
can be applied outside of machine learning and neural networks, and to use another optimization method
([ILP](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Integer_programming)).

It was also awesome to explore different NLP techniques, such as word graphs and n-grams.

I suspect the reason this method failed is because the tweets selected are too different; the word graph is excellent at
taking similar tweets, and then finding a word path which extracts only the useful information from them. Since I started
with the tweets selected by [COWTS](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/summarizing-tweets-in-a-disaster-e6b355a41732),
the tweets were already a summarization.

If I tried again, I would use a broader range of tweets, to try and take advantage of this.
