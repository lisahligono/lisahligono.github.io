## An avanced framework for semantic querying of the dynamic world dataset

### What is the 'Dynamic World'?
This is a LULC dataset provided by Google and the World Resources Institute. The Dynamic World dataset offers near real-time global Sentinel-2 land use/land cover (LULC) mapping, generated using a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN).

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to showcase how semantic querying can enhance the analysis of the Dynamic World dataset beyond simple mode-based temporal reduction. By employing semantic querying techniques, users can perform more complex spatial and temporal analysis, unlocking new insights and possibilities for utilizing the dataset.

### Methodology

### Future Directions

- Integration of semantic querying framework directly into Google Earth Engine for seamless analysis.
- Testing the dataset and semantic querying approach in various applications to explore its full potential.
