Hello! My name is Gabi. I am a PhD student at [McGill](https://www.mcgill.ca/) / [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), working under the supervision of Professor [David Rolnick](https://davidrolnick.com/) to investigate ways in which machine learning can help fight climate change. This includes working with Professor [Hannah Kerner](https://hannah-rae.github.io/) at [NASA Harvest](https://nasaharvest.org/).

My research focusses on applications of machine learning to remote sensing for agriculture. We can [learn a lot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16866) about global agricultural practices from satellite data, and we generate an enormous amount of satellite data. I investigate how machine learning algorithms can be applied to this satellite imagery. In particular, I think about how we can take advantage of the metadata which accompanies satellite imagery and agricultural data to [improve machine learning in this regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02124).

In addition to machine learning for remote sensing and agriculture, I have been lucky to contribute to:
* **Technology for good**, such as for [sustainable and regenerative farming](https://www.smallrobotcompany.com/), or to [increase energy access](https://okrasolar.com/)
* **Interpretable machine learning** using [open source tools](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)

I also love spending time outdoors, either by [climbing](https://i2.wp.com/oolongaloha.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1600244370139-1-scaled.jpg?strip=info&w=2000&ssl=1) or [running](https://i0.wp.com/oolongaloha.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DJI_0070-1-scaled.jpg?w=2280&ssl=1) in [beautiful](https://i2.wp.com/oolongaloha.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/IMG_20211120_122140.jpg?strip=info&w=1254&ssl=1) [places](https://i2.wp.com/oolongaloha.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_4514.png?w=2280&ssl=1).

In addition to the technical blog [here](/blog), I also have a non technical blog, at [oolongaloha.com](http://oolongaloha.com)
