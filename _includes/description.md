üåç **About Me**

Hi there! I am Lisah Ligono, currently undertaking the role of an Erasmus Scholar within the Copernicus Master in Digital Earth Program ([CDE](https://master-cde.eu)). This prestigious program has afforded me the opportunity to traverse the captivating landscapes of Salzburg, Austria, and the coastal allure of Bretagne Sud, France. My endeavors are deeply rooted in the exploration of geodata science and its profound implications for addressing significant environmental challenges, particularly in the realm of climate change mitigation. Within the program, my specialization lies in the **Geodata Science track**, where I am thoroughly engaged in the utilization of advanced technologies to analyze and interpret complex spatial data. My focus extends to the pivotal role of biodiversities, such as mangroves, in fostering ecological equilibrium and mitigating the impacts of climate change.

ü§ñ **Exploring AI/ML/DL**

In my geodata science pursuit, I am actively exploring the realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL). I am captivated by their potential to revolutionize remote sensing methodologies and enhance our understanding of Earth systems dynamics.

üèÜ **Extracurricular Endeavors**

Outside of academia, I actively participate in hackathons, where I relish the opportunity to collaborate with peers and devise innovative solutions to pressing challenges. My involvement in these endeavors has been met with commendation, further fueling my passion for interdisciplinary problem-solving.
