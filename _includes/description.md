Hi there! I am Lisah Ligono, currently undertaking the role of an Erasmus Scholar within the Copernicus Master in Digital Earth Program ([CDE](https://master-cde.eu)). This program enables me to study in two countries (Austria and France) that will lead me to in graduating with a European double master degree. This experience has enabled me live in diverse regions in Europe, from the captivating mountanious landscapes of Salzburg to the coastal allure of Vannes. 

My specialization lies in the **Geodata Science track**, where I am thoroughly engaged in the utilization of advanced technologies to analyze and interpret complex spatial data. I am intrigued by emerging technologies thus my motivation in working in the [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) domain.


Outside the classroom, I actively participate in hackathons and conferences, where I relish the opportunity to collaborate with peers and devise innovative solutions to pressing challenges. My involvement in these endeavors has been met with commendation and I have been honoured to win coveted awards such as:

* **Copernicus Masters Space Awards 2022**, wining the Regional Prize Madrid/Spain
* **2 ML4Earth prizes**, both in 2022 (second place) and 2023 (first place)
