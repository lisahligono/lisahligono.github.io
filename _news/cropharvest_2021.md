The CropHarvest dataset is accepted at NeurIPS, in the dataset and benchmarks track! We compile multiple agricultural land cover datasets, and couple it with satellite data in an ML-ready format. Check out the [python package](https://github.com/nasaharvest/cropharvest), [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=JtjzUXPEaCu), and [tweet summary](https://twitter.com/gabriel_tseng/status/1490727718425710594).
