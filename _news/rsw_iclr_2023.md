I'm at ICLR in Kigali, helping to organize the [Machine Learning for Remote Sensing Workshop](https://nasaharvest.github.io/ml-for-remote-sensing/iclr2023/). I'll be moderating a panel at the workshop with [Esther Rolf](https://www.estherrolf.com/), [Kristof Van Tricht](https://remotesensing.vito.be/team/kristof-van-tricht), [Abigail Annkah](https://research.google/people/106787/) and [Anthony Ortiz](https://www.anthonymlortiz.com/). Let me know if you're at ICLR and would like to grab coffee!
