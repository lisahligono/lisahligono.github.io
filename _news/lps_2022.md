I'm at the Living Planet Symposium in Bonn (alongside [lots of other Harvest folks](https://twitter.com/HarvestProgram/status/1528855612775452683)), where I presented [TIML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02124) at the [Representation learning in EO](https://twitter.com/devistuia/status/1528988104639528961) session. If you are also at LPS, come say hi!
